# Assignment 1


First install 'Anaconda'. This is a package that includes Python, a coding environment (named Jupyter) and other helpful things (text editor, commonly used packages). Jupyter allows you to organize/run Python code on your computer through a web page. 

### Installing Anaconda on Windows: See [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) 

Step 8: I suggest to check the first checkbox ('Add Anaconda3 to my PATH variable'). This will allow you to run Python from any folder on your computer, and more easily install addons.

### Installing Anaconda on Mac: See [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)

## Required

Write a Python program that asks for user input (ask the user to enter their age), and then offer an alcoholic beverage of your choice or apple juice depending on the user's age. Let the user input the beverage, and print a message to confirm ('You will be drinking XXXX', or 'You will be drinking apple juice').

Your program needs to reject the user's input if the user does not enter a number. Note, you may have to convert the user's input to an integer (int) using the `int` function. 

See [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp) for an example to get user input.


Please submit your python code along with the output of the program. (In Jupyter Notebook, click 'File', 'Download as', 'HTML')

# Use web resources

There are lots of resources on the web to help getting Python to do what you want. Use Google to search for queries like 'Python input number', or 'Python test for equality'.
